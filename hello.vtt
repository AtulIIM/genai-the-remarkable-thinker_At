1
0:00:00----> 0:00:09.760000
If you want to change the world, start off by making your bed.

2
0:00:09.760000----> 0:00:15.280000
If you make your bed every morning, you will have accomplished the first task of the day.

3
0:00:15.280000----> 0:00:20.240000
It will give you a small sense of pride, and it will encourage you to do another task,

4
0:00:20.240000----> 0:00:22.640000
and another, and another.

5
0:00:22.640000----> 0:00:27.520000
And by the end of the day, that one task completed will have turned into many tasks completed.

6
0:00:27.520000----> 0:00:32.160000
And your bed will also reinforce the fact that the little things in life matter.

7
0:00:32.160000----> 0:00:37.880000
If you can't do the little things right, you'll never be able to do the big things right.

8
0:00:37.880000----> 0:00:42.880000
And if by chance you have a miserable day, you will come home to a bed that is made.

9
0:00:42.880000----> 0:00:50.560000
That you made, and a made bed gives you encouragement that tomorrow will be better.

10
0:00:50.560000----> 0:00:53.360000
I've been a Navy SEAL for 36 years.

11
0:00:53.360000----> 0:00:59.040000
Every morning in SEAL training, my instructors who at the time were all Vietnam veterans,

12
0:00:59.040000----> 0:01:01.320000
would show up in my barracks room.

13
0:01:01.320000----> 0:01:04.040000
And the first thing they'd do was inspect my bed.

14
0:01:04.040000----> 0:01:08.360000
If you did it right, the corners would be square, the covers would be pulled tight,

15
0:01:08.360000----> 0:01:12.500000
the pillow's centered just under the headboard, and the extra blanket folded neatly at the

16
0:01:12.500000----> 0:01:13.500000
foot of the rack.

17
0:01:13.500000----> 0:01:20.680000
It was a simple task, mundane at best, but every morning, we were required to make our

18
0:01:20.680000----> 0:01:21.680000
bed the perfection.

19
0:01:22.360000----> 0:01:25.800000
It seemed a little ridiculous at the time, particularly in light of the fact that we

20
0:01:25.800000----> 0:01:30.680000
were aspiring to be real warriors, tough battle-hardened seals.

21
0:01:30.680000----> 0:01:36.880000
But the wisdom of this simple act has been proven to me many times over.

22
0:01:36.880000----> 0:01:41.520000
It matters not whether you ever served a day in uniform.

23
0:01:41.520000----> 0:01:46.360000
It matters not your gender, your ethnic or religious background, your orientation or

24
0:01:46.360000----> 0:01:48.160000
your social status.

25
0:01:48.160000----> 0:01:52.440000
Our struggles in this world are similar, and the lessons to overcome those struggles,

26
0:01:52.440000----> 0:01:57.600000
and to move forward, changing ourselves and changing the world around us will apply equally

27
0:01:57.600000----> 0:01:59.240000
to all.

28
0:01:59.240000----> 0:02:06.360000
If you think it's hard to change the lives of 10 people, change their lives forever,

29
0:02:06.360000----> 0:02:07.360000
you're wrong.

30
0:02:07.360000----> 0:02:10.920000
I saw it happen every day in Iraq and Afghanistan.

31
0:02:10.920000----> 0:02:15
But changing the world can happen anywhere and anyone can do it.

32
0:02:15----> 0:02:20.680000
So what starts here can indeed change the world, and you will likely fail often, and

33
0:02:20.680000----> 0:02:22.240000
it will be painful.

34
0:02:22.240000----> 0:02:23.320000
It will be discouraging.

35
0:02:23.320000----> 0:02:32.120000
At times, it will test you to your very core.

36
0:02:32.120000----> 0:02:38.400000
At that darkest moment of the mission is a time when you need to be calm, when you must

37
0:02:38.400000----> 0:02:44.360000
be calm, when you must be composed, when all your tactical skills, your physical power,

38
0:02:44.360000----> 0:02:48.400000
and your inner strength must be brought to bear.

39
0:02:48.400000----> 0:02:56.440000
If you want to change the world, you must be your very best in the darkest moments.

40
0:02:56.440000----> 0:03:02.480000
If I have learned anything in my time traveling the world, it is the power of hope.

41
0:03:02.480000----> 0:03:09.120000
The power of one person, a Washington, a Lincoln, King Mandela, and even a young girl from Pakistan,

42
0:03:09.120000----> 0:03:10.200000
Malala.

43
0:03:10.200000----> 0:03:16.200000
One person can change the world by giving people hope.

44
0:03:16.200000----> 0:03:18.800000
Start each day with a task completed.

45
0:03:18.800000----> 0:03:20.360000
Find someone to help you through life.

46
0:03:20.360000----> 0:03:22.280000
Respect everyone.

47
0:03:22.280000----> 0:03:24.920000
Know that life is not fair and that you will fail often.

48
0:03:24.920000----> 0:03:29.440000
But if you take some risks, step up when the times are the toughest.

49
0:03:29.440000----> 0:03:33.440000
Face down the bullies, lift up the downtrodden, and never, ever give up.

50
0:03:33.440000----> 0:03:39
If you do these things, the next generation and the generations that follow will live in

51
0:03:39----> 0:03:41.960000
the world far better than the one we have today.

52
0:03:41.960000----> 0:03:47.320000
And what started here will indeed have changed the world for the better.

53
0:03:47.320000----> 0:03:52.280000
Finally, in SEAL training, there is a bell.

54
0:03:52.280000----> 0:03:57.080000
A brass bell that hangs in the center of the compound for all the students to see.

55
0:03:57.080000----> 0:04:00.600000
All you have to do to quit is ring the bell.

56
0:04:00.600000----> 0:04:03.840000
Ring the bell, and you no longer have to wake up at five o'clock.

57
0:04:03.840000----> 0:04:08.600000
Ring the bell, and you no longer have to be in the freezing cold swims.

58
0:04:08.600000----> 0:04:13.440000
Ring the bell, and you no longer have to do the runs, the obstacle course, the PT.

59
0:04:13.440000----> 0:04:18.560000
And you no longer have to endure the hardships of training.

60
0:04:18.560000----> 0:04:26.560000
All you have to do is ring the bell to get out.

61
0:04:26.560000----> 0:04:34.600000
If you want to change the world, don't ever, ever ring the bell.
